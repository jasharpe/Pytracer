## Requirements

* Python
* pygame (for rendering images as pngs)

## Usage

If you want to render a scene described in `data/SCENE_NAME.py`, enter the following from the top level directory:

    python main.py SCENE_NAME

A simple example has been provided as `data/myscene.py`.

## Capabilities

So far, Pytracer can:

* draw spheres
* do simple ambient, diffuse and specular lighting, with correct shadowing
